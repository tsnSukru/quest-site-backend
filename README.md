# quest_site
quest site with springboot-hibernate-react
Project Name
Quest-Site is a program that I am developing in my spare time. It consists of a backend component, which I have implemented, and a frontend component, which is being built based on the ideas and tutorials from the Dilruba Köse channel on YouTube. I strive to follow the principles of clean code and SOLID design.

Technologies Used
The project is being developed using the following technologies:

Backend:

Spring Boot: A Java-based framework for building backend applications.
Hibernate: An object-relational mapping (ORM) library for database management.

Frontend:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Uploaded as another repository in my profile.

Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to Dilruba Köse for the inspiration and guidance provided through her YouTube channel.
